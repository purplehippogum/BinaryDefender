### Game Information
  + Game Name: Binary Defender
  + Game Description: Fight the evil swarms of the letter A with an arsenal of numbers
  + [Game Design Doc](GameDesignDoc.md)
  + Known bugs: collision detection is finicky around corners of blocks. Just restart the game if it happens.
  + For some reason restarting the application resets the GUI appearance to a Windows 95 kind of interface. The main game still functions fine despite this.
