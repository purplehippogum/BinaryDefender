## Game Breakdown

### Gamepley Overview
The object of the game is to survive oncoming waves of enemies for as long as possible. Points are earned for each enemy killed. Players control a stationary character that can turn in any direction and ward off foes with a basic shooting attack. Enhancing the player's basic attack are the numbers in the **binary** scoring display. The player can choose either 1 or 0 **from the score display** to enhance his/her basic attack. Taking a digit from the score display decreases the score by that amount. The player loses health upon colliding with an enemy. The enemy is destroyed in the process. Once the player's health has been depleted, the game is over and the (non-binary) score will be displayed.

##### Header 5

You can also write in **bold** or _italics_. You can also ~~strike through~~ or write inline `Code Segments`

>Blockquotes are done as such.

Just make sure to separate paragraphs with an emptyline. 
Otherwise, they are considered in the same paragraph.

You link to [Google](https://www.google.com) as such and lists are written has follows:
  1. First you indent with two empty spaces.
  1. Then, you use:
    * `1.` to signal an ordered (i.e. numbered) list, or
    * `*`, `-`, `+` to represent an unordered list.
      1. Make sure to maintain indentation
      1. As it is used to identify sub-lists
  1. Numbering and symboles don't matter as they are auto-generated later.

Tables are pretty easy to make:

| Tables        | Are           | Easy          |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -------------:|
| left-aligned  | centered      | right-aligned |
| header are    | bolded and    | centered      |
| zebra stripes | are neat      | 1             |
